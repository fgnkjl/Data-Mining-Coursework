        "  - Click on \"File -> Save a copy in Drive\" and open it in Colab afterwards\n",

        "2.   Rename your notebook to **surname_forename_studentnumber.ipynb**\n",
        "  - Make sure to exactly follow this naming scheme (don't replace `_` with `-` or something like that)\n",
        "  - **Failure to comply with this scheme results in -10 points!**\n",
        "3.   For math exercises, use $\\LaTeX$  to typset your answer\n",
        "4.   For coding exercises, insert your code at `# TODO` statements\n",
        "5.   For multiple-choice questions, choose an answer from the drop-down list\n",
        "6.   Before submitting your notebook, **make sure that it runs without errors when executed from start to end on Colab**\n",
        "  - To check this, reload your notebook and the Python kernel, and run the notebook from the first to the last cell\n",
        "  - **If your notebook throws any errors, you will be penalized by -25 points in addition to any penalities from incorrect answers**\n",
        "  - We are not going to fix any errors (no matter how small) to make your code work\n",
